### Css Variables

CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow you to declare a variable in CSS and then use it throughout your stylesheet. This can help make your code more maintainable and reduce repetition.

Here's an example of how to use CSS variables:

```
    :root {
    --main-color: #006699;
    }
```
